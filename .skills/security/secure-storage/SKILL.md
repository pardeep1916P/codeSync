- [src/storage/index.ts](file:///c:/Users/chait/OneDrive/Desktop/codeSync/src/storage/index.ts) for storage settings
- [src/queue/index.ts](file:///c:/Users/chait/OneDrive/Desktop/codeSync/src/queue/index.ts) for queue workflows
- [src/background/index.ts](file:///c:/Users/chait/OneDrive/Desktop/codeSync/src/background/index.ts) for alarms and service workers
